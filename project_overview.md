# COMP0031_acoustic_holography
Analysis of BEM on different objects and surfaces: 
- experiments measuring the impact of different reflector surfaces on the trap force, gorkov potential, distance from the object surface and computation time.
- simulating most of them and 3D printing a few different surfaces to test with the real setup
